[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tylerstar/twitter-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tylerstar/twitter-api)


A web server powered by Django that help you to fetch tweets via Twitter APIs.

## Description

This project include two APIs.

1. Fetch recent tweets by a hashtag `/hashtags/<hashtags>`
   
    Example request:
    ```curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:xxxx/hashtags/Python?limit=40```
    
    Example response:
    ```
    [{"account": {"fullname": "Raymond Hettinger",
                  "href": "/raymondh",
                  "id": 14159138},
      "date": "12:57 PM - 7 Mar 2018",
      "hashtags": ["#python"],
      "likes": 169,
      "replies": 13,
      "retweets": 27,
      "text": "Historically, bash filename pattern matching was known
               as \"globbing\".  Hence, the #python module
               called \"glob\".\n\n
               >>> print(glob.glob('*.py')\n\n
               If the function were being added today, it would probably
               be called os.path.expand_wildcards('*.py') which would be
               less arcane."},
      ...
    ]
    ```
   
2. Fetch user's recent tweets by twitter user's [screen_name](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/data-dictionary/overview/user-object#:~:text=In%20case%20of%20Retweets%20and,using%20the%20id%20or%20screen_name%20.)

    Example request:
    ```curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:xxxx/users/twitter?limit=20```

    Example response:
    ```
    [{"account": {"fullname": "Twitter",
                  "href": "/Twitter",
                  "id": 783214},
